description: Use when modeling a closed set of related types in Kotlin — phrases like "sealed class", "sealed interface", "ADT", "algebraic data type", "exhaustive when", "compile-time pattern matching", "Result type", "I have N variants and want the compiler to make me handle every one". Defines Kotlin's sealed hierarchies + exhaustive `when` as the language's pattern-matching primitive — the foundation for state machines, result types, command types, AST nodes, and many GoF substitutes.

## One-line summary

Combine a `sealed class` or `sealed interface` (closed variant set) with an exhaustive `when` expression — getting compile-time-checked pattern matching that the compiler refuses to compile when a variant is unhandled.

## When to use this skill

- Modeling a closed, finite set of variants: order status, parser results, command types, AST/expression nodes, network response shapes.
- Replacing `enum` when variants need to carry different data (an enum is a set of singletons; a sealed hierarchy is variants-with-payload).
- Implementing GoF State, Visitor, or Command patterns in idiomatic Kotlin.
- Wherever you have a "type code + switch" pattern in older code — sealed + when is the structural fix.

## When NOT to use this skill

- The set is genuinely open-ended (third parties or downstream modules can add new variants) — use an open interface instead.
- The variants share no behavior or data — they might not belong as a hierarchy at all. Consider whether the discriminator is the wrong abstraction.
- A simple `enum` suffices because the variants are pure tags with no payload.

## Core content

Two key Kotlin language features cooperating:

**Sealed types.** A `sealed class` or `sealed interface` declares: "the set of direct subtypes is closed, declared in this file (or this module since Kotlin 1.5)". The compiler knows the full set.

```kotlin
sealed interface Result<out T> {
    data class Success<T>(val value: T) : Result<T>
    data class Failure(val error: DomainError) : Result<Nothing>
    object Pending : Result<Nothing>
}
```

**Exhaustive `when`.** When `when` is used as an *expression* (its value is assigned or returned), the compiler requires every variant to be handled. Forgetting one is a compile error.

```kotlin
fun render(r: Result<User>): String = when (r) {
    is Result.Success -> "Welcome, ${r.value.name}"
    is Result.Failure -> "Error: ${r.error.message}"
    Result.Pending    -> "Loading…"
}
// Add a new variant and this when stops compiling until you handle it.
```

The compiler's exhaustiveness check is the pattern's main value. It eliminates a whole category of "forgot to handle this case" bugs that hide in `if`/`else if`/`else` chains and `switch` statements.

**`sealed class` vs `sealed interface`.** Prefer `sealed interface` unless you need shared state or a common constructor in the parent. Sealed interfaces allow a variant to implement multiple sealed hierarchies, which can be useful for cross-cutting state.

**`data object` (Kotlin 1.9+)** is the right choice for stateless variants — gives sensible `toString`/`equals` and signals intent. Older code uses plain `object`.

## Decision heuristics

- Closed variant set + variants carry different data → sealed hierarchy.
- Closed set of pure tags, no payload → `enum class`.
- Open set (extensible by consumers) → open interface.
- Want compile-time exhaustiveness → make the `when` an expression (assign its result or return it), not a statement.

## Anti-patterns

- `else` branches in `when` over sealed types — silently swallows new variants the compiler would have flagged.
- Sealed hierarchy with one subtype — single variant means no exhaustiveness benefit; reconsider whether you need the hierarchy at all.
- Sealed hierarchy where downstream modules need to add variants — defeats "closed". Open it up.
- Using `when` as a statement (`when { … }` with no value) over a sealed type and forgetting that the compiler doesn't enforce exhaustiveness in statement form. Make it an expression.
